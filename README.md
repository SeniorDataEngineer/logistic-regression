# <a name="standards"></a>Standards
All code has been checked with `pycodestyle` utility to match  
**pep8** guidance. 
## Usage of `pyscodestyle`
Navigate to directory where the file you want to test is located  
using `cd` in terminal. Run `pycodestyle filename.py` and wait  
for output in terminal. If no output standard is met.

## Unit testing
The unit tests for the package are stored in the python modules
as doctests. When running a module standalone the doctests will
be called for that module.  
To run tests; navigate to *src/my_k_means/* and run command  
`python -m filename.py`.
